# Privacy Policy

Your privacy matters.

This website does not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it (for example, by contacting me, subscribing to updates, or requesting services).

Any analytics data (if enabled) is used only to understand site traffic and improve content.

If, in the future, this website offers paid services (such as consultations, training, or courses) or displays advertisements, any personal or payment-related information will be handled securely and only for the purpose of providing those services.

I do not sell, trade, or share personal information with third parties except where required to deliver a requested service or comply with legal obligations.

If you have any questions about privacy, please use the Contact page.
