# About Me

Hi, I’m Tarun Gupta 👋

I’m a Business Intelligence (BI) developer with a background in both management and engineering. I’ve been working with BI tools like Power BI and Tableau for about seven years, mostly helping teams turn messy data into something they can actually use.

Somewhere along the way, I got hooked on statistics, DAX, and data modelling. This blog is where I share what I’ve learned — the things that worked, the mistakes I made, and the little tricks that save time in real projects.

## What You’ll Find on Analyst in Action

On Analyst in Action, you’ll mostly find:
- Practical, hands-on tutorials  
- Examples from real-life BI problems  
- Tips on tools like Power BI, Power Query, DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, and more  

I see knowledge a bit like good food: it’s better when it’s shared.
